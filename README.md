this is the project for developing a presentation on inventive ideas in the hackathon at holberton in the community
=====================

The overall idea of the project exists in phone apps. modern technology and how people are interacting with each other on a day to day basis. in general we should live in a shared world, break cultural norms or barriers but also that is the sense of realizing that is exactly what evolution is to a generation. its how the (music) video killed the radio star. Or how rock and roll is dead to the digital age bc the audience changed, or the appriciation changed. The world is always changing and there's a need to be part of the technilogical evlolution. 

My best thought rests in ARVR, and the gaming community. But, i personally cannot say that i've been really a big gamer. The last game i was actually good at was between splinter cell and or Halo back when it iwas a big deal to network xbox's in a room with a group of friends and play a full 4 screen 16 player halo game. 

But, of course time has changed. 

So, i'm not necissarily trying to come up with the next best game.. but i want to utilize the idea of a game that can be used on your phone and connect virtually while looking for something practical to use. that is a platform that is entraprenurial, or resourceful in a sense, that sponsors itself unlike other gaming apps to live and survive. it would need a subscription just for the base of an economical fee. But, thats where the idea BEGINS!

====
The gaming community is the freelancing of the idea! -- its simple, not complex, its an idea where gamers can work in their field and develop a virtual implemntation and expand on a more resourceful market. Their connection can be athletetes, dancers, football players, body builders, golfers, pool players, tennis players, or job training for certifications you can perform in your own home. The gamers are like the "taylors" of the ARVR world to share others vision or accomplishments others who are wanting to learn or build a skill can be tutored and or tailored to understand forthemselves through a platform of virtual reality.

I thought of the gaming aps because in a sense they are the cheapest, they're the most used, and some companies like roblox develop multiple games using the same simple creation/idea hence the method of applying the technology into a grouped selection or grouped area of selection for kids that are safe for parents to leave their kids with an ipad or phone. 

so. 

The marketing of the app is through sponsorship until one applies to actually subscribe like $2 to be part of the app community and play all the games advertisement free.

but this can also be interactive marketing.

try a new tutor out, or coach out, learn about their experience, and learn the athletic "positions" you are working on with the coach and have a replay through virtuality to see the pros and cons instantly after applying the new exersize or the new method of technique


=========================================


The gaming platform offers "features" for advertisement that can be interacted with. I see ARVR	using the same platform as gaming APPS.
 given there will be sponsorship given the freelancing side of the actual community.


the philosophy rests in the fact that there can be a few developers who curate a global family.

TALENT is everything that is being "tailored" for the cause. Talent for the development.

============
freelancing comes through the "sponsorship" philosophy. Waht i actually mean by the app being an interactive vehicle to market say an instrctor yoga etc.)

an example of this would be Escoffier, which has a full kitchen development program to be a certified baker or chef! start your resturaunt! -- start anything, ARVR, give tours and etc of what is expected and have online training for 10 different locations to start a business in 10 different cities by finding those with the same common interest, who value the companies platform or belief system to carry out the commissioned work to be invested into the company short term or long term. 

Talent, the intellectual property in how the developmente of the marketing of a product can be carried out practically, using an impractical idea as a philosophy, that works in a new world.

local community vs. global community.
========================================

on that note. what is being tailored and developed as a platform for entreprenuers is something that can be budgeted to a highly talented indiviual; target audience is a must, knowing your niche, the community and emotional connection to feel what is being learned or implemented is something that is ideal to the customer who's investing in themselves. Also, action to take trainging into your own hands, own your talent and to implement the blueprint for others to follow. has to be user friendly and easy to follow, and an easy "try this" tutorial of what can be learned with 15 seconds of interaction from the coach teaching someone technique.
